<div align="center"><h1>Idea</h1></div>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This project aims to create a beautiful web application based on a REST API that provides information about products.

<div align="center"><h1>Springboot</h1></div>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Springboot is really easy to use and building apps like this become intuitive. To start a new one, we can use [this tool](https://start.spring.io/) and then select wich dependencies we want. Recommended:  JPA, Starter Web, Devtools, Swagger2, Postgres. (all of our resources are origin from a postgres database)

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You can visit the [springboot folder](https://github.com/kammradt/products-springboot-vue/tree/master/springboot) to access the related repository part.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The finished API documentation made with [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) can be found [Here](https://apirest-products-study.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html).

<div align="center"><h1>Vue.js</h1></div>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Vue.js is kinda "new", it's great for fast development, and it also has a great community and docummentation. So I decided to learn it and use in this project (and others).
